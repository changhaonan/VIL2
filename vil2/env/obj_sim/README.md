# ObjSim

This module tries to simulate the movement of objects.

## Overall

We consider `2 * 4 = 8` different ways to build the object movement model.

As for the horizon, we consider 2 different structures.

1. Horizon based
2. Way-point based

As for the movement carrier, we consider two major ways: 1. Rigid body as whole. 2. SuperVoxel.

## Evaluation

The key evaluation here is: how good it is we can recover the trajectory in reality setting. How good it is that we can use it in real-world robotics application.
